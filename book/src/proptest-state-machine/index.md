# The `proptest-state-machine` crate

The `proptest-state-machine` crate provides a lightweight framework built on top of `proptest` for testing systems against a reference implementation

It is recommended to have a basic working understanding of the [`proptest`
crate](/proptest/index.md) before getting into this part of the
documentation.

**This crate is currently 0.x and quite fresh.** It will see breaking
changes while in its infancy.

If you're an early adopter of `proptest-state-machine` and have any suggestions, [open an issue on our github repo](https://github.com/proptest-rs/proptest/issues/new).
