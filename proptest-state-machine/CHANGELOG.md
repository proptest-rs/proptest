### Other Notes

- Set MSRV to 1.82, which is what minimally compiles and completes testing.

## 0.3.0

  ([\#388](https://github.com/proptest-rs/proptest/pull/388))

## 0.2.0

### Other Notes

- `message-io` updated from 0.17 to 0.18

### Bug Fixes

- Removed the limit of number of transitions that can be deleted in shrinking that depended on the number the of transitions given to `prop_state_machine!` or `ReferenceStateMachine::sequential_strategy`.
- Fixed state-machine macro's inability to handle missing config
- Fixed logging of state machine transitions to be enabled when verbose config is >= 1. The "std" feature is added to proptest-state-machine as a default feature that allows to switch the logging off in non-std env.
- Fixed an issue where after simplification of the initial state causes the test to succeed, the initial state would not be re-complicated - causing the test to report a succeeding input as the simplest failing input.
