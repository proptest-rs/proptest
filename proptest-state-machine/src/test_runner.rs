/// This macro helps to turn a state machine test implementation into a runnable

/// syntax rules: First, we declare if we want to apply the state machine
/// transitions sequentially or concurrently (currently, only the `sequential`
/// is supported). Next, we give a range of how many transitions to generate,
/// followed by `=>` and finally, an identifier that must implement
/// `StateMachineTest`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// struct MyTest;
///
/// impl StateMachineTest for MyTest {}
///
/// prop_state_machine! {
///     #[test]
///     fn run_with_macro(sequential 1..20 => MyTest);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example will expand to:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// struct MyTest;
///
/// impl StateMachineTest for MyTest {}
///
/// proptest! {
///     #[test]
///     fn run_with_macro(
///         (initial_state, transitions) in MyTest::sequential_strategy(1..20)
///     ) {
///        MyTest::test_sequential(initial_state, transitions)
///     }
