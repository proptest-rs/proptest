/// This trait is used to model system under test as an abstract state machine.
///
/// The key to how this works is that the set of next valid transitions depends
/// on its current state (it's not the same as generating a random sequence of
/// transitions) and just like other prop strategies, the state machine strategy
/// attempts to shrink the transitions to find the minimal reproducible example
/// when it encounters a case that breaks any of the defined properties.
///
/// This is achieved with the [`ReferenceStateMachine::transitions`] that takes
/// the current state as an argument and can be used to decide which transitions
/// are valid from this state, together with the
/// [`ReferenceStateMachine::preconditions`], which are checked during generation
/// of transitions and during shrinking.
///
/// Hence, the `preconditions` only needs to contain checks for invariants that
/// depend on the current state and may be broken by shrinking and it doesn't
/// need to cover invariants that do not depend on the current state.
///
/// The reference state machine generation runs before the generated transitions
/// are attempted to be executed against the SUT (the concrete state machine)
/// as defined by [`proptest::state_machine::StateMachineTest`].

///    unseen transitions, then the next step will start at trying to delete
///    the transition before the last one seen as we know that the last
///    transition cannot be deleted as it's the one that has failed.
/// 2. Then, we keep trying to delete transitions from the back of the list, until
///    we can do so no further (reached the beginning of the list)..
/// 3. Then, we again iteratively attempt to shrink the individual transitions,
///    but this time starting from the front of the list - i.e. from the first
///    transition to be applied.
/// 4. Finally, we try to shrink the initial state until it's not possible to
///    shrink it any further.
