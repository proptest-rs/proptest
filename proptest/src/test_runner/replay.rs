/// A "replay" of a `TestRunner` invocation.
///
/// The replay mechanism is used to support forking. When a child process
/// exits, the parent can read the replay to reproduce the state the child had;
/// similarly, if a child crashes, a new one can be started and given a replay
/// which steps it one complication past the input that caused the crash.
///
/// The replay system is tightly coupled to the `TestRunner` itself. It does
/// not carry enough information to be used in different builds of the same
/// application, or even two different runs of the test process since changes
/// to the persistence file will perturb the replay.
///
/// `Replay` has a special string format for being stored in files. It starts
/// with a line just containing the text in `SENTINEL`, then 16 lines
/// containing the values of `seed`, then an unterminated line consisting of
/// `+`, `-`, and `!` characters to indicate test case passes/failures/rejects,
/// `.` to indicate termination of the test run, or ` ` as a dummy "I'm alive"
/// signal. This format makes it easy for the child process to blindly append
/// to the file without having to worry about the possibility of appends being
/// non-atomic.
