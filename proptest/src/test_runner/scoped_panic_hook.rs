mod internal {
    //! Implementation of scoped panic hooks
    //!
    //! 1. `with_hook` serves as entry point, it executes body closure with panic hook closure
    //!     installed as scoped panic hook
    //! 2. Upon first execution, current panic hook is replaced with `scoped_hook_dispatcher`
    //!     in a thread-safe manner, and original hook is stored for later use
    //! 3. When panic occurs, `scoped_hook_dispatcher` either delegates execution to scoped
    //!     panic hook, if one is installed, or back to original hook stored earlier.
    //!     This preserves original behavior when scoped hook isn't used
    //! 4. When `with_hook` is used, it replaces stored scoped hook pointer with pointer to
    //!     hook closure passed as parameter. Old hook pointer is set to be restored unconditionally
    //!     via drop guard. Then, normal body closure is executed.
